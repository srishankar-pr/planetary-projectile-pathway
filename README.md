## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter

  
---

## Usage

- Follow the terminal prompts to select a planet or custom gravity
- Enter velocity, angle, and wind if prompted
- The animation window will pop up; stats and trajectory will update as the projectile "flies"
- Close the window to try another launch or exit
